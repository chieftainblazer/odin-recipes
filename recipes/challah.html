    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Challah bread is a white, leavened, braided bread with Ashkenazi Jewish origins. It's typically made with eggs,
      yeast, flour, honey (or sugar), and salt.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 <span>&#189;</span> cups warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon active dry yeast</li>
      <li><span>&#189;</span> cup honey</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
      <li>3 eggs, divided</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
      <li>8 cups unbleached all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon poppy seeds (Optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
      <li>
        Pour warm water into a large bowl; sprinkle yeast over water. Let stand until yeast softens and begins to form
        a creamy foam, about 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Beat in honey, oil, 2 eggs, and salt. Add flour, 1 cup at a time, beating after each addition until dough has
        pulled together.
      </li>
      <li>Turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic.</li>
      <li>Place dough in a large, lightly-oiled bowl and turn to coat.</li>
      <li>
        Cover with a towel and let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 1 <span>&#189;</span> hours.
      </li>
      <li>
        Punch down dough and turn onto a lightly floured surface. Divide in half and knead each half for 5 minutes or
        so, adding flour as needed to keep it from getting sticky.
      </li>
      <li>Divide each half into thirds and roll into a long snake about 1 <span>&#189;</span> inches in diameter. </li>
      <li>
        Pinch the ends of the three snakes together firmly and braid from middle. Either leave as a braid or form into
        a round braided loaf by bringing ends together, curving the braid into a circle, and pinching ends together.
      </li>
      <li>
        Grease two baking trays and place the finished braid or round on each. Cover with a towel and let rise for 
        about 1 hour. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
      </li>
      <li>Beat the remaining egg and brush a generous amount over each braid; sprinkle with poppy seeds.</li>
      <li>
        Bake in preheated oven until golden brown, about 40 minutes. Cool on a wire rack for at least one hour before
        slicing.
      </li>
    </ol>
