This project is the project named "Recipes" from the foundations course from The Odin Project.
Upon completion of this project, I should have demonstrated basic knowledge on writing a basic 
HTML web page.

Reflection:
-After completing this project, I feel that I've gained more knowledge in setting up a basic HTML page with elements such as a list or images.
